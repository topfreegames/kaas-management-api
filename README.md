# Kubernetes clusters as a service Management API

The purpose of this project is to create and manage Kubernetes clusters inside a management cluster running ClusterAPI.
It aims to be agnostic and easy to integrate with other services, in a way that  they donâ€™t need to know specifics of the ClusterAPI to do Kubernetes clusters management

The project is still in early stage of development
